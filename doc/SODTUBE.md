# Sod Shock Tube problem 

The first test case we made is the Sod Shock Tube in 1 dimension. 
In this basic problem the domain is split using a membrane. 
Then the membrane is removed and the relaxation can start. 

The initial conditions are the followings: 

$\[P,\rho,m,u] \rightarrow \[0.1,1.0,?,u\]$
